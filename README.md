## 🔭 I’m currently working on
- My personal portfolio and blog ([discoverlance](https://discoverlance.com))
  - For my blog I actually wanted to use **hashnode** but I also really want to practice writing markdown and building stuff myself so decided to use [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) and their `@nuxt/content` module. 
- I am also working on releasing a personal startup project (cloudatrest / babycloud) to discuss all things cloud and application development

## 🌱 I’m currently learning
- Vue.JS
- Nuxt.JS
- Improving my javascript skills
- AWS Application development (hoping to go for the AWS Associate Developer certification soon)

## ⚡ Fun facts
- I really love daily.dev and as you can see my **Dev Card** above.
- I am a huge fan of anime and am currently binging **One Piece*.
